##A-Explain the key features of NumPy and highlight the major differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists with appropriate examples.
**Key Features of NumPy**

1-NumPy provides a high-performance N-dimensional array (ndarray) that is faster and more efficient than Python lists.

2-It supports vectorized operations, meaning mathematical operations can be applied to entire arrays without loops.

3-NumPy offers many built-in mathematical functions and supports broadcasting, which allows operations on arrays of different shapes.

**Differences Between NumPy Arrays and Python Lists**

**1-Data type:**
NumPy arrays store elements of the same type, while Python lists can store mixed data types.

**2-Speed and performance:**
NumPy arrays are faster and more suitable for numerical computations, whereas lists are slower.

**3-Memory usage:**
NumPy arrays use less memory compared to lists.

**4-Mathematical operations:**
NumPy allows direct operations like addition and multiplication on arrays, while lists need loops.
